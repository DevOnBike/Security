# Heimdall
all around security like algorithms, approaches to common problems ready to be used in your project:
- chacha20 poly 1305 (pure .net + BouncyCastle - can be used interchanbly)
- xchacha20 poly 1305 algorithm (pure .net + BouncyCastle - can be used interchanbly)
- format preserving encryption (FPE using BouncyCastle)
- default (recommended) IRandom implementation
- hashers abstractions and implementation (for calculating digest of generic data and password)
- post quantum cryptography (ML-KEM, ML-DSA)
